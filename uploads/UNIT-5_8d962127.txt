5. Modern Physics
5.1 Laser
5.1.1 Introduction

Laser (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation): A device that emits coherent, monochromatic, and highly directional light.
Key Components:
Active Medium: Gas, liquid, or solid (e.g., ruby, CO₂).
Pumping Source: Energy source to excite atoms (e.g., flash lamp).
Optical Cavity: Mirrors for feedback.

5.1.2 Absorption and Emission

Absorption: Electron absorbs energy and jumps to a higher energy level.
   $$ E_2 - E_1 = h\nu $$
Spontaneous Emission: Electron returns to lower energy level randomly, emitting a photon.
Stimulated Emission: Incoming photon triggers excited electron to emit coherent photon.

5.1.3 Laser Principle

Population Inversion: More electrons in excited state than ground state (achieved by pumping).
Optical Feedback: Mirrors amplify light through repeated passes.

5.1.4 Characteristics of Laser Beam

Coherence: Waves are in-phase (temporal and spatial).
Monochromaticity: Single wavelength (e.g., He-Ne laser: 632.8 nm).
Directionality: Narrow beam divergence (e.g., &lt; 1 milliradian).
High Intensity: Focused energy over small area.


5.2 Applications of Laser
5.2.1 Engineering Applications

Cutting/Welding: Precision machining of metals.
3D Scanning: LiDAR for topographic mapping.
Communication: Fiber-optic data transmission.

5.2.2 Medical Applications

Surgery: Laser eye surgery (LASIK).
Dermatology: Tattoo removal, skin resurfacing.
Dentistry: Cavity detection and gum treatment.


5.3 Optical Fibre
5.3.1 Principle of Optical Fiber

Total Internal Reflection (TIR): Light reflects entirely at the core-cladding interface.
Condition: $$ \theta_i &gt; \theta_c \quad \text{(Critical Angle)} $$

5.3.2 Parts of Optical Fiber

Core: Central glass strand (high refractive index, $$ n_1 $$).
Cladding: Outer layer (low refractive index, $$ n_2 $$).
Buffer Coating: Protective plastic layer.

5.3.3 Types of Optical Fiber

Single-Mode Fiber: Thin core (8–10 μm), carries one light mode (long-distance communication).
Multi-Mode Fiber: Thick core (50–100 μm), carries multiple modes (short-distance).

5.3.4 Applications of Optical Fibre

Telecommunications: High-speed internet (5G networks).
Endoscopy: Medical imaging inside the body.
Sensors: Temperature, pressure, and strain sensing.


5.4 Introduction to Nanotechnology
5.4.1 Nano Materials

Definition: Materials with at least one dimension between 1–100 nm.
Example: Carbon nanotubes, quantum dots.

5.4.2 Types of Nanomaterials

0D: Nanoparticles (e.g., gold nanoparticles).
1D: Nanowires/nanotubes (e.g., carbon nanotubes).
2D: Graphene, thin films.
3D: Nanocomposites (e.g., aerogels).

5.4.3 Properties at Nano Scale

Surface Area: $$ \text{Surface-to-Volume Ratio} \propto \frac{1}{r} $$ (increases as size decreases).
Quantum Confinement: Band gap changes with size (e.g., quantum dots).
Enhanced Reactivity: Catalytic efficiency improves.

5.4.4 Applications of Nanotechnology

Electronics: Smaller, faster transistors.
Medicine: Targeted drug delivery.
Energy: Efficient solar cells, batteries.
Textiles: Stain-resistant fabrics.
